# Telegram Lyrics Bot

A simple Telegram bot built using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) that allows users to send the name of a song and receive the lyrics in return. The bot is designed to be lightweight, with the option to add translation support in future iterations.

## Features

- Uses `Telegraf` as the bot framework.
- Automatically restarts using `nodemon` during development for easier testing.
